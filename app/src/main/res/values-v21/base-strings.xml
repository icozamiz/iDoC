            This test records video with flash to obtain the pupillary response to light. With regards to an mTBI, the symptom of \'\'sensitivity to light\'\' can be attributed to the pupil\'s inability to constrict, therefore, this test checks the pupil\'s ability to respond.

            This test records video with flash to identify if the patient has any nystagmuses. With regards to an mTBI, the symptom of \'\'dizziness\'\' can be attributed to the involuntary movements of the eye (nystagmus). This test tracks the pupil as it moves left and right to identify any of these \'\'jerky\'\' movements.

            This cognitive test records video with flash to identify if the patient is cognitively \'\'sluggish\'\', meaning their reaction time and comprehension of spoken word orders are slower than normal (often seen in mTBIs). This test identifies any \'\'sluggish\'\' condition with the operator asking the patient to move their eye in the opposite direction of what was asked.
